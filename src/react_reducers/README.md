# Redux.js Reducers Folder

This folder contains the 'react_reducers.js' file that acts as Redux state management for the application. The reducer file contains an object that holds all the state for the project and functions that change the state when called. This is done so that the state variables can be called through-out the application without having to directly push each variable to each component when needed. Now, these variables can be simply called at any time from the reducer / data layer and manipulated as such.
